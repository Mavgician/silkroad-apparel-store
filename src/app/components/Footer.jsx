              <p>
                Our store was founded in 1860 by two best friends, John Henry R.
                Relucio and John Mark B. Ormido of New Haven, Connecticut. They
                have always had a passion for fashion and clothing design. When
                they shared a dorm room in college, Henry and John Mark began
                crafting their brand, image, and concept for their first clothing
                store they would be opening. They didnâ€™t want to limit their
                concept to just young, trendy styles.
